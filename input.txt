We first begin with what the Earth looked like millions of years ago. The famous Supercontinent Hypothesis explains the jigsawlike arrangement of the continents we observe today. It posits that all continents were once joined together in a single landmass that has since drifted apart over hundreds of millions of years. This unified landmass, known as Pangea, existed from about 300 to 200 million years ago, from the late Paleozoic Era until the late Triassic. As an example, North America was not separated by the Atlantic Ocean as it is today but instead was directly contiguous with what we now know as Africa, South America, and Europe.

The image you see on the left side is a representation of Pangea. It might look unfamiliar to your current understanding of our world's geography, but it represents a significant chapter in Earth's geologic history. Each piece of this supercontinent would eventually separate, drift, and morph into the continents we recognize today.

These continental shifts didn't happen randomly. They were, and still are, driven by a powerful geologic process known as Plate Tectonics.

Plate Tectonics theory explains the structure of the earth's crust and many associated phenomena as resulting from the interaction of rigid lithospheric plates. These plates, sections of the Earth's outermost layer, move slowly but inexorably over the somewhat pliable underlying layer, called the mantle.

This second image on the right provides a depiction of the Earth's lithospheric plates as we understand them today. These plates are in constant, albeit slow, motion. Their interactions, including separation, collision, and sliding against each other, are responsible for Earth’s most dramatic geological events and landforms, including earthquakes, volcanic activities, mountain formation, and yes, the drifting apart and coming together of continents.

Thus, the once unified Pangea has fractured and drifted to form our current continents, guided by the forces of plate tectonics. These theories not only explain the present arrangement of the Earth’s surface but also allow scientists to reconstruct our planet's geologic past and predict future shifts.

Understanding these concepts of Supercontinent Hypothesis and Plate Tectonics equips us with a remarkable perspective on how dynamic and ever-changing our planet is, even if these changes occur over timescales far longer than human history. They demonstrate the power and longevity of the geological forces that shape our world.
